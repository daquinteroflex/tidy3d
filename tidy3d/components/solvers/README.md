# Simulation Solvers

All simulation solvers get integrated in this directory, and managed within here. 

Now, there is inherently a problem of inheritance in terms of where to manage data, since that is one of the assumptions of how we want to structure our solver architecture. In that case, it is not inconcievable to arrange them according to the physics they represent, in a way similar to other solvers.

TODO:

- [ ] Add base solvers here.
